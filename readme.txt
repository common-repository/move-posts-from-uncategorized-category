This plugin automatically scans for posts in the Uncategorized category of your WordPress blog, and removes them from the category.

== Description ==

** this plugin is no longer being update. Please feel free to adopt me! **



This plugin automatically scans for posts in the Uncategorized category of your WordPress blog, and removes them from the category if the posts match certain criteria.

* There must be a category with the slug 'uncategorized' on your blog;
* There must be posts in that category;
* The posts in that category must also belong to another category;

If all those criteria are met, the plugin with automatically remove the post from the Uncategorized category of your WordPress blog.

The plugin runs automatically on page loads, depending on the number of posts it finds the first time it loads may take significant resources. As it loads each time, it will require less and less resources until there are no Posts left in the uncategorized category. Disable the plugin at any time to stop it loading.
